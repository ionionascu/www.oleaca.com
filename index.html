							<p>Creator of Awesome Software</p>
							<p>I do not think I have heard someone saying it like this, but many believe that the cheap developers (and IT guys in general) are more expensive than the expensive ones. :) Basically it is down to what is the difference between a good developer and a slightly better one? Well, ten times. What about the difference between a bad one and a good one? You have most certainly seen the answer.</p>
							<p>With today's needs for IT skills, many learn software development. Some get to lead teams and projects. And some even get to design software. But the difference remains.</p>
							<p>So, what do you need? You could go for ticking business requirements on a sheet of paper and hope that they are done and will not come back as production incidends. Or you could worry less about building the software applications and think more about the business.</p>
